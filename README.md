## This is a group project involving exactly two students.

You should design and implement classes such as Person (BTW, let’s treat the wolf as a person), Thing (e.g., cap, wine, 
cake, ), GPS (i.e., location for homes, specific trees, or a particular spot “in the wood”), Time (e.g., JvTime), and 
particular Record (when, where, who, and which things).
Your test program will need to show the following FOUR records:
1. Little Red Ridding Hood wore the Cap
2. Her mom gave her the cake and wine
3. Little Red met the wolf at a particular spot in the wood
4. Grandma was at her own home right outside of the wood and there were three large tree
